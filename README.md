## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

#### I'm a university student in the field of Software IT Development. My main specializations and passions include back-end web development, database management and developing in SQL, and anything C# related.<br />
#### I primarily use GitHub to share my projects that I've been tinkering with in my free time, or to keep stuff I worked on at school in a place where I (or you!) can take a look at, anytime.
